<h1>About University</h1>
<p1>The University of Hyderabad (UoH), one of the major institutions of higher education in India is largely devoted to postgraduate studies and is widely known for its excellence in research and for its distinguished faculty. Founded in 1974 with Prof. Gurbaksh Singh as its first Vice Chancellor, UoH - also known as Hyderabad Central University or HCU- has emerged as a leading centre of teaching and research. The large campus located near Gachibowli, which is the IT hub of Hyderabad, has immense bio-diversity and is home to over 75 varieties of bird, not to speak of the lakes and rock formations which give the campus a natural beauty.

With 46 different Departments and Centres organized in 12 Schools of study, the University has over 400 faculty and over 5000 students. School of Economics started three years back.  Prof. G. Nancharaiah was the first dean, then Prof. K. N. Murhty for two months and now it is Prof. B. Kamaiah.  The University offers close to 150 different programmes of study ranging from doctoral studies to Masters level degrees, as well as a range of post graduate diplomas and short term courses by Distance mode. It also has a thriving Five year Integrated Masters Programme. The University hosts an ever increasing number of foreign scholars in the highly popular Study in India Programme. The University has built up a reputation for providing high quality academic training, and has been recognized through a number of awards: PURSE, given by the Prime Minister of India, a grading of A, which is the highest, by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). International measures of research excellence also show the preeminence of UoH - the University is counted among the top 100 in Asia in many of its academic areas of study. These include the Basic Sciences, Applied Sciences, Medical Science, Engineering Science, the Social Sciences, the Humanities, and the Arts, Fine Arts, Media Studies and Communication, in addition to more recent efforts in areas such as Folklore Studies, Health Psychology, Dalit Studies, Women’s Studies, Neural and Cognitive Sciences.

The faculty of the UoH have a high national and international profile and have been recipients of major national and international awards- the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize of the CSIR, the Ramon Magasaysay Award, the J C Bose Fellowship of the DST, the Humboldt Prize, the TWAS Awards, the British Council, Commonwealth and Fulbright awards, and the Padma Awards of the Government of India. Several of our faculty also belong to major national and international Academies - the Indian National Science Academy (INSA), the Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc), the National Academy of Sciences of India (NASI), the Indian National Academy of Engineering (INAE), the Sahitya Akademi, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS).

The entire campus is connected on 1 Gbps NKN connectivity, Wi-fi enabled and this facilitates networking, vital for sustaining academic activity. In terms of infrastructure and other collateral support, the University has been proactive. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Library at the University has a collection of more than 3.56-lakh books and other reference material and subscribes to about 600 foreign journals and 18,000 online journals and 10 online databases. This fully computerized Library with special software for visually-challenged students operates through the week.

A large number of Institutions find their home on our campus, and we have close academic links with them. These include the C R Rao Advanced Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (AIMSCS), the Association of Management Development Institutions of South Asia (AMDISA), the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), The Energy Resources Institute (TERI), the National Institute for Smart Government (NISG), the National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB) and the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) and the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS). The National Museum of Statistics, SANKHYA, is being set up on the campus, the first of its kind.

The University of Hyderabad has seen considerable growth in the past few years, with the introduction of new courses of study, new disciplines, and new initiatives. With the range of disciplines represented and the quality of the faculty and students at UoH, the University- which is among the finest in the country- is well poised to make its mark internationally as well

<h1>School of Computer and Information Sciences</h1>
<p>School of Computer and Information Sciences (SCIS) offers high quality postgraduate teaching and research in all major areas of Computer and Information Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, and, Banking Technology and Information Security. Computer Science programme in University of Hyderabad was started in 1983 under the School of Mathematics and Computer/Information Sciences.  Computer and Information Sciences was carved out as a separate Department under the School of Mathematics and Computer/Information Sciences on March 23, 1993. This department became School of Computer and Information Sciences on January 22, 2013.

SCIS epitomizes excellence in all major functions associated with higher learning such as teaching, research, student development and curriculum planning. The strengths of the School are its quality faculty, innovative and flexible curricula with their unique focus on post-graduate education, state-of-the-art research with a remarkably high number of Ph.D scholars - both ongoing and recently graduated, and highly open and transparent policies that foster a healthy student-faculty interaction. SCIS always stood for innovation and leadership in curriculum planning - having one of the oldest (from 1983) and even now one of the best MCA programmes; boldly proposing and introducing the M. Tech programme in Artificial Intelligence in 1986 to attract the small but growing number of undergraduates in computer science; and, in 2002, introducing the unique M. Tech in Information Technology (with specialization in Banking Technology and Information Security) in collaboration with IDRBT (Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, a sister Institute of RBI) aimed at bridging the shortfall of trained computer professionals in banking and finance industries.

With nearly 93% of the faculty possessing a Ph.D and considerable experience in teaching in conjunction with a relatively young average age of around 45 years, the School rightfully boasts of a faculty profile that is young, vibrant and matching the very best in national and international standards. Some of the faculty are Fellows, Senior Members of prestigious international and national professional societies such as IEEE, TAS, APAS and IETE, and are on various Boards of Studies, Governing Boards, Standing Committees and Editorial Board of Journals. The faculty have won many awards and have been invited to reputed international universities and other institutions. It is reflection of SCIS creative atmosphere and academic credentials that it has been able to attract and retain such a faculty.
